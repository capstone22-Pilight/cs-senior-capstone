\subsection{Fall Update 1}
Our first week of the capstone project "Not exactly the Internet of Things for Outdoor Lighting" was relatively uneventful, as we spent most of the time starting to meet with the client and coordinating with the group for meeting times.\\
Plans for the coming week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start to work with the hardware as soon as we get it. This will probably consist of booting the Raspberry Pi with an operating system and compiling MicroPython on the Wifi Modules
\item if we get far enough, work on communication between the Pi and the controllers
\end{itemize}
Progress since last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item We got our project and met with the client
\item We finished our proposal document
\end{itemize}
No major issues this week\\
