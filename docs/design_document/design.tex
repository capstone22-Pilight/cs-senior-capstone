\section{Overview}

In the twenty-first century, your home should be smart and responsive. An
automated home should be able to control appliances such as lights through
single-board computer units that have Internet connectivity. Many commercial
options exist such as those from Nest Labs, but such devices are prohibitively
expensive for most consumers, especially for simple tasks such as lighting
automation. This project aims to provide an low-cost alternative for simple
home automation, such as for devices that are exclusively binary like lights
and simple heating elements. Using a low-cost embedded computer such as the
Raspberry Pi and cheap wireless communication modules such as the ESP8266, this
project will provide a cheap, easy-to-install home automation system.

The project is called "Not Exactly the Internet-of-Things" because it's not
designed as a typical IoT product. The network is entirely local, not worrying
about an external connection to the Wide Area Network. Some additional
components such as consulting an external API could be considered, but that's
an addon to the finished product. As it is made as a user home application, it
is readily accessible through smartphones and web interfaces. With a clean user
interface that enables both manual control and automation profiles, the
application will require a minimal learning curve and be simple to set up.
