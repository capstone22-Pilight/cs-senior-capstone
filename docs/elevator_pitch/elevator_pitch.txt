You're sitting on your back porch.  The sun is setting.  Your throat tickles as
the cool wind brushes across your face.  You reach out into the dark abyss,
longing for something, ANYTHING to quench that thirst, vainly grasping nothing
but the night itself.  All hope is lost.  You muster the will to stand, but
just as you begin your perilous trek to the light switch, you remember
something.  You have a Cupcake Warriors (tm) Home Lighting Automation System!
