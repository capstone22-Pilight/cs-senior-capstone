You're sitting on your back porch.  The sun is setting.  You let out a dry
cough as you reach for your drink, grasping into the dark abyss.  You can't see
it; all hope is lost.  You muster the will to stand, but just as you begin your
perilous trek to the light switch, you remember something.  You have a home
lighting automation system!  Your lights spring into action, illuminating the
void before you, thrusting your entire home into the 21st century!  You swiftly
pull out your phone, and with a few deft strikes, the lights multiply.  Two!
Three!  Fifty!  They intensify, they strobe, they don't break the bank!  Open
source software, running on commodity hardware, all controllable from your
phone.  Simple, powerful, wireless.  For all the lights in your home.
Enlighten yourself.
